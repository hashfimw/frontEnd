                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Im Mister Bean, I am a passionate individual currently enrolled in a 
                Fullstack Web Development bootcamp at Digital School Technology Purwadhika. 
                I am working towards becoming a skilled Web Developer and, eventually, 
                expanding into Mobile App Development. Though I don't have any projects under my belt yet, 
                I am determined to build a future where I contribute to hundreds or even thousands of projects. 
                I am eager to grow, learn, and take on challenges in the world of development.
